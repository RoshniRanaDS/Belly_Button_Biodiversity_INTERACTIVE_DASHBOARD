# Interactive dashboard   
Have created Interactive Dasboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site.  
which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.  

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs,   
in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.  
Following Screenshots are attached from my Work

# Instructions
1. Used the D3 library to read in "samples.json" from the URL "https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m14/lms/starter/samples.json."  
2. Created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.  
   - Used "sample_values" as the values for the bar chart.  
   - Used "otu_ids" as the labels for the bar chart.  
   - Used "otu_labels" as the hovertext for the chart.
