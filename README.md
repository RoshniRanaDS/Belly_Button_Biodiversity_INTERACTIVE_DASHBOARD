# Interactive dashboard   
Have created Interactive Dasboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site.  
which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.  

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
